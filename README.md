# AI-8-puzzle-solver-using-numpy
This project is an implementation of an AI-based solver for the 8-puzzle problem using NumPy. The 8-puzzle is a sliding puzzle that consists of a 3x3 grid with numbered tiles. The goal is to arrange the tiles in any order that is possible with the given initial configuration and the goal configuration, with an empty space, by sliding tiles into the empty space.the code finds the no of moves required for the transition by finding the sequence of steps the puzzle undergoes.

## Features

- Solves the 8-puzzle problem using an AI algorithm.
- Visualizes the puzzle-solving process.
- Utilizes NumPy for efficient matrix operations.
